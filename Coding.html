          <h1>Coding Experience</h1>
          <h2 class="Coding">
            I’m not an advance coder at the moment but I’m still learning. I
            started off learning Python basic taking an online course on skill
            share. This really help me understand other project I found online
            to improve on their codes to make the application run better. A
            project I contributed was a gaming cheating software where I improve
            the codes to make the application work better in game. Then I moved
            on to learn HTML and CSS, I watch a two-hour crash course. Learning
            these certain languages of coding before starting college help me
            get through class labs and assignments very quickly as I already
            knew the basics. I created multiple fun web site projects on my own
            to understand and adapt to HTML and CSS quicker. (You can look at the bottom and see an example of a site I created for fun with my codes) I’m at the moment
            learning Java at school and on my free time which is possibly the
            hardest language I have learned so far, but I’m slowly understanding
            it each day.
