      <h1>Fitness</h1>
      <h2 class="Fitness">
        Growing up through high school I wasn’t always the type of teen that ate
        food as much, I had an eating disorder that was very unhealthy. I use to
        eat only once a day and sometimes not even eat at all if I didn’t feel
        like it. When I started college studying business marketing at the age
        of 19, my friends motivated and push me to start lifting weights. This
        started off as a hobby at the start in my first year of college but it
        turned out to become a lifestyle as I been lifting for 7 years. I
        learned and made many new friends in my fitness journey that help me get
        through my ups and downs in life. I learned a lot about nutrition and
        how our body works with eating certain food. I been doing body building
        for 6 years but recently started to focus on powerlifting, which is
        mainly focusing on strength training. I have showed people that its
        possible change yourself if you put in discipline in your lifestyle and
        lost 25-30lbs. I have increased my lifts drastically and pulled some
        impressive numbers. My favorite part of fitness is helping others
        achieve the same goals because I was once in their position, and seeing
        other people achieve their goals puts a smile on my face. At the right
        side you can notice some images and videos of lifting and how I use to
        look like. At the bottom you can notice the days I use to lift and what
        I use to hit during those days.
