      <h1>Future</h1>
      <h2>
        While studying in Humber College, I will be created multiple projects
        with HTML and Java to grow my github portfolio. This will show future
        recruiters how dedicated I am in learning and improving my coding
        skills. My goals are to either get into Co-op in Humber to get some
        experience in the work force in front end web designing or to get my
        first internship in the summer. I would like to have a full-time
        position as a web designer for a company after I'm done college. As well
        as create my own mini projects at home for myself. Iâ€™m very grateful
        that I have many friends in the compute programming career that can help
        me get through any challenges I face in the future, and hopefully create
        projects with them as well.
