        <p>
          Hello, my name is Fahim Kakar. I’m a student at the moment in Humber
          College studying computer programming. I have some knowledge in coding
          such as Python, HTML, CSS, and a bit of Java. I also have completed a
          degree in Business Marketing from Sheridan College. One of my
          passionate other than learning how to code is fitness and health. Ever
          since I started going to the gym at the age of 19, I became in love
          with lifting weights as it helps me release stress. You can learn more
          about my fitness journey on my fitness page. I have many personal
          interests in my life which are gym, coding, soccer, travelling and
          many more. I always believe as long as you put in hard work and
          discipline in your lifestyle, you can achieve anything in this world.

        <summary>Past Life</summary>
        <p>
          I was born in Afghanistan but came to Canada at the age of 4 in 2000
          and was raise here my whole child hood. Growing up in school, I wasn’t
          the most intelligent kid but I would always try my best to learn and
          push myself. In high school I had no clue what I wanted as career path
          in my future and decided to take business marketing. After high school
          I started off studying business marketing but started to lose interest
          second year of college as I didn’t see that as a career that fits my
          personality trait. I worked multiple jobs through my early 20s growing
          up but recently notice most of my friends studying computer
          programming, that’s when I decide to learn how to code a bit myself. I
          started off learning Python from an online class on my free time then
          moved onto HTML and CSS. Once I was comfortable of understanding a bit
          of coding I decide to go back to college and get a degree in computer
          programming.
